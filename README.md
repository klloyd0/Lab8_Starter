## Short Paragraph

Both graceful degradation and service workers prioritize basic functionality, specifically in the event of limitations, such as their network being offline (service workers) or unavailable features like Javascript or CSS (graceful degradation). While their purposes by definition appear different, they all the more ensure accessibility for users, whether it might be they could be using a device that doesn't support Javascript or they're somewhere with little to no network connection. The website still shows up with a strong network connection, and the more advanced features are still present somewhere in the background, but having service workers and approaching web development from a graceful degradation standpoint help provide a sort of fallback as opposed to having a website crash entirely for either reason.
